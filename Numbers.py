# Compulsory Task 1
Num1 = input("Enter your first number:")# Allows user to input their first number and saves it as variable number1
Num2 = input("Enter your second number:")# Allows user to enter their second number and saves it as variable number2
Num3 = input("Enter your third number:") # Allows the user to enter their third number and saves it as a variable number3
#The following changes the strings entered as Num1, Num2 and Num3 to integers
Num1 = int(Num1)
Num2 = int(Num2)
Num3 = int(Num3)
print (Num1 + Num2 + Num3)# Displays the awnser for adding all three numbers
print (Num1 - Num2)# Displays the answer for subtracting the second number from the first
print (Num3 * Num1)# Displays the product of the first and thrid number
print ((Num1 + Num2 + Num3) / Num3)# Displays the answer for the addition of all three number divided by the third number
